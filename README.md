# The Risk of Unjustified Counterfactual Explanations (TRUCE)

This repository will contain  the code for two linked papers:
- *The Dangers of Post-hoc Interpretability: Unjustified Counterfactual Explanations*, Laugel T., Lesot M.J., Marsala C., Renard X., Detyniecki M. - IJCAI 2019 (to appear)
- *Unjustified Classification Regions and Counterfactual Explanations in Machine Learning*, Laugel T., Lesot M.J., Marsala C., Renard X., Detyniecki M. - ECML-PKDD 2019 (to appear)

Current code has not been cleaned and still lacks some dependencies. Current code will be split in two for each article.
